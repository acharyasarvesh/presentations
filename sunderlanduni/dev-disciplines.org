#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    - Single Responsibility Principle - a class should have only a single responsibility
    - Open for Extension, Closed for Modification
    - Liskov Substitution Principle - "objects in a program should be
      replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering
      the correctness of that program."
    - Interface Segregation Principle - “many client-specific
      interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”
    - Dependency Inversion Principle - one should “Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.”
#+END_QUOTE
#+REVEAL: split
   * Referential transparency
   * Immutability
   * Reduced side effects

** What's most important?

   I had a manager who asked?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  How do you know when you've finished?
#+END_QUOTE
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    - You decide what success is
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    - You write tests to prove it
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    - You implement your code
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    - You run your tests
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    - They pass
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
    **YOU'RE DONE!**

** Test, test, test again...

 [[./automatedtestingpyramid.png]]

*** Types of testing?

** Tests to discover design

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Test Driven Development
#+END_QUOTE

*** Test Driven Development
  What is Test Driven Development?

*** What?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Incremental process to build low level design through the feedback
  mechanism of tests, written tests first.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Why?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   - Tests code (automated and run in build).
   - Evolves design constantly checking against tests for 'completeness'.
   - Provides automated 'safety net' to catch 'breaking changes'.
   - Enables rapid and radical design changes in future.
   - Avoids 'big ball of mud'
#+REVEAL: split
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Good design is testable,
And design that isn’t testable is bad.
#+END_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“I haven’t got time to test that…”
If it's worth building, it's worth testing.
#+END_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If it's not worth testing, why are you wasting your time working on it?
#+END_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Tests are your first users.
#+END_QUOTE
#+REVEAL: split
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Tests can be your documentation
#+END_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If TDD hurts..you're doing it wrong.
#+END_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“The story of the unforeseen requirement.”
#+END_QUOTE

[[./debug.gif]]

*** How?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   1. Write a (failing) test.
   2. Run a (failing) test.
   3. Write the (simplest) implementation to get the test to pass.
   4. Run test (if pass do next step else do 3)
   5. Refactor implementation (and/or test) to remove duplication.
   6. Repeat from step 1.

*** How?

[[./TDD Activity Diagram.png]]

*** When?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag grow highlight-red
   ALL THE TIME

*** TDD?

   Test
   Driven
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag grow highlight-red
   Design

** Version Control - SCM

   Git, Subversion, CVS, VSS, Mercurial, PVCS

*** What it's *not*

   * Backup
   * Centralised code sharing

*** What it is

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  **Integrate code across team**

*** Why is it important?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  It tells a story.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  It protects you from mistakes.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
  It enables review.

** Other Important Disciplines?
*** Continuous Integration
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    "Continually integrating (and testing) code across a team."
#+END_QUOTE
  * Merging code regularly.
  * Regression testing.

*** Continous Build

[[./jenkins.png]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    "Continually build (and testing) code across a team."
#+END_QUOTE
  * Automated builds.

#+REVEAL: split

[[./jenkins-build.png]]

  * Build on merges.
  * Tests run on build.

*** Continous Deployment
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    "Continually deploy (verified) code to 'live'."
#+END_QUOTE
  * Automated deployment.
  * 'Push Button' deployment.

*** Static Code Analysis Tools

#+END_QUOTE

#+REVEAL: split

*** Automated Code Formatter
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    "Automatically format code to 'team' or 'organisational' standards."
#+END_QUOTE
*** Property or Generative Testing
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    "In computer science, a property testing algorithm for a decision
 problem is an algorithm whose query complexity to its input is much
 smaller than the instance size of the problem. Typically property
 testing algorithms are used to decide if some mathematical object
 (such as a graph or a boolean function) has a "global" property,
 or is 'far' from having this property, using only a small number
 of 'local' queries to the object."
#+END_QUOTE
#+REVEAL: split
   *WHAT?*
#+REVEAL: split
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    "A high level approach to testing in the form of abstract
    invariants [that] functions should satisfy universally."
#+END_QUOTE
#+REVEAL: split
   *WHAT?*
#+REVEAL: split
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    "Property-based tests make statements about the output of your code
    based on the input, and these statements are verified for many different possible inputs."
#+END_QUOTE

*** Command Line is your Friend
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    "Don't be afraid of the command line."
