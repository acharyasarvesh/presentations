<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Been programming for over 40 years, professionally for over 30.</li>
<li>I've been designing software systems for over 25 years</li>
<li>Started in monolithic homogeneous environment - mainframes</li>
<li>Automating basic processes in a large government org that changed rules every couple of years with change of the minister but within parameters mainly controlled by the speed with which the org could respond.</li>
<li>Environment was constrained and could only change at a fairly slow rate</li>
<li>In the 90's/00's software centred companies competed with new features as their selling point so speed of change became a competitive advantage.</li>
<li>Now we work in markets driven by customers that interact directly rather than indirectly.</li>
<li>Companies are built up around providing services that don't exist before the company introduces it.
<ul>
<li>Facebook (although arguably MySpace was also in that field)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Companies that are build a business model around a uniqueness - Google</li>
<li>Companies even more frequently provide solutions to problems that already have solutions but they add some additional novelty, usually in the form of features that provide a different form of
interaction with the customer that didn't exist before the software was written.
<ul>
<li>Apple does this but often in the form of physical design combined with software e.g. the iPod wheel as the hook and iTunes which provided an interface that other MP3 download sites didn't have.</li>
<li>Slack does what IRC has done for 30 years but provided a UI that was more tactile and visual (introducing previews for images, emoji) but also, the killer feature, was a persistent history
making the communication more async as you don't need to be online at the same time. Also providing a fermium model and removing the hosting barriers of some competitors. Having the message
limits meant you can be away from the convo for a while but not too long introducing a compulsion to check regularly. Also focusing on teams rather than threaded comments, initially they
implemented everything as a continuous stream which encouraged constant checking which is encourages compulsive behaviour.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>We see companies starting with one vision of their offering but changing direction, sometimes quite radically.
<ul>
<li>Stuart Butterfield has done this a few times:
<ul>
<li>Ludicorp founded 2002 to build a game (called Game Neverending)</li>
<li>2004 - game failed to gain traction but embedded photo-uploading was popular.</li>
<li>2005 - game crumbled but Flickr rose from ashes</li>
<li>2006 - Flickr sold to Yahoo</li>
<li>2008 - Stuart left Yahoo to found Tiny Spec creating a game called Glitch.</li>
<li>2010 - raised Series A funding, no detail about game but it was described as web-based massively-multiplayer game (Massively Mulitplayer Online Role-Playing Game MMORPG) epected launch 2010.</li>
<li>2011 - raised more funding. Invite-based Beta. Launch but returned to Beta to make it easier for new players</li>
<li>2012 - became obvious Glitch could not attract audience large enough to sustain itself. Glitch dead- Tiny Spec was not.</li>
<li>2013 - internal comms tool used to share ideas between the US and Canadian offices of Glitch recognised as valuable</li>
<li>2014 - Slack was announced.</li>

<h2 id="org7f9ff95">+ve feedback mechanisms</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Positive feedback in software is driven by external agencies such as customer demand, management demand, changes in organisational focus.
</p>

<p>
Studies have show that too much positive feedback promoting large changes in a single generation (version) of software systems tends to have a destabilising effect if there is not a commensurate
negative feedback loop to dampen the effect. This can be seen in the 8 Laws of Software Evolution documented by M.M.Lehman.
</p>

<p>
Positive feedback loops in software development (evolution) are the introduction of new features, new capabilities, changes in business model resulting in massive changes in structure and
capabilities of not just the software design itself but in the structure of the team and the processes adopted by the team in software development (evolution).
</p>

<p>
This is not always negative - positive feedback introducing changes in development process or materials can provide balanced growth if the changes introduced have inherent constraints that
provide a negative feedback loop or dampening effect to appropriate characteristics of the system design or the development process.
</p>

<p>
As an example, introducing a new programming language that has features that encourage constraints such as immutable data and pure functions can reduce the complexity of concurrent processing
and simplify the developers mental model to not have to consider how state changes over time or race conditions etc. except at the edges of the system/component/service where state changes are
pushed i.e. HTTP request/response, I/O to file systems or databases.
</p>

<p>
Another example of positive feedback in the form of a change to the development process that intentionally introduces a constraint to guide development might be the introduction of WIP limits on
a Kanban board. WIP limits ensure the development team are only working at the capacity they can sustain. They reduce the amount of waste in the process in the form of work at rest (waiting to
be started). They also highlight when the team has too much work concurrently to manage. WIP limits also make it easier to tune cycle time (time between the work starting and delivery/) and lead
time (time between a feature/story/requirement being raised and delivered).

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Adaption
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanisms that involve large changes to respond to environment pressures in the ecosystem. For example, a large and permanent temperature change, the introduction on competitive species.</li>
<li>Adaption involves changes in the phenotype, therefore involving a new generation (version) of the 'species'. For
example, adult stature or eye colour.</li>

</ul>
<p>
Acclimatisation
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanisms that involve typically smaller variations in phenotypically plastic characteristics. For example,
adjustments in heart rate, skin colour and attention span.</li>

</ul>
<p>
Other mechanisms
</p>
<ul>
<li>there are mechanisms in Epigenetics where external or environmental factors result in a heritable phenotype change
or phenotypically plastic changes. For example, stress factors in the environment may trigger a gene to activate or
inhibit the expression of a gene without actually changing the nucleotide sequence.</li>

<p>
Biological responses
</p>

<ul>
<li>Most organisms can't respond to major changes in their Biome by acclimatisation as the small variations possible
are usually changes that are only capable of responding to the smaller variations that are confined to the local
ecosystem of the habitat or biotope.</li>

<li>Gradual or smaller changes to the biome can be responded to by adaption that happen in one or two generations
through epigenetic mechanisms such as phenotype plasticity. These might be something like a dormant gene being
activated by external factors. Morphological plasticity can be seen in pond snails that develop spiny shells in the
presence of predators.</li>

<li>Larger changes in the biome require more major genetic changes in the DNA and occur through a number of mechanisms,
the best understood of which is gene mutation but recent research suggests other mechanisms such as stress hormones
altering RNA transcription and the adoption of phenotypically plastic traits.</li>

<p>
Software response
</p>

<ul>
<li>The possible response mechanisms in software are controlled by the development team and associated stakeholders. The
team can adopt techniques that provided a 'guided' evolutionary mechanisms.</li>

<li>Smaller changes can be made in days in one generation (version) either by tweaking parameterised features or making
small code changes to the internal mechanisms in a service or application. Generally speaking making these changes
quickly is much easier if the software component is smaller.</li>

<li>Larger changes to response take more major changes internally but also tend to change the interfaces of the software
component. I.e. the interface for clients or the persistent data used is changed. These changes tend to alter
factors that a coupled to other software components or to external customers/systems.</li>

<li>What is frequently overlooked is that often this kind of change has an impact on the more complex microecosystem.
As an example, making a change to add something to an API changes the responsibilities of the software component
involved in a way that may mean that the component is now taking on responsibilities that it didn't have before.
This can result in other software components at a later time connecting to the first to use this new responsibility.
This kind of network effect increase the amount of communication and coordination required and hence may increase
cross network traffic and result in hot-spots in the architecture.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Feedback loops in Code
</p>

<ul>
<li>In general mechanisms to respond to stimuli that are built into 'code' or even 'configuration' tend to be negative
feedback loops that respond to a an external stimuli by damping down or stabilising the software system.</li>

<li>Good examples of this would be circuit breakers, bulkhead patterns or rate limiting.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Feedback loops in Development team and process
</p>

<ul>
<li>The development team and the processes and tools that they use are a mix of negative feedback loops and positive
feedback loops. Generally speaking, these changes are adopted to facilitate faster changes in certain directions.
However, conversely, often the approaches and tools are successful in this because they have constraints (or
negative feedback) that provides guide rails that push development towards the desired characteristics.</li>

<li>As examples:
<ol>
<li>adopting Kanban properly can greatly increase the speed of response to changes in the habitat but Kanban as a
process has at it's heart strong constraints on the amount of work in progress at any point in time.</li>
<li>adopting a functional programming language with immutable data structures can reduce the effort involved in
developing software that has concurrent processes.</li>
<li>adopting a microservices architecture that constrains the responsibility of a service to just one small part of
a domain can result in the ability to respond faster to changes as a microservice can be changed in hours or
replaced in days or a week.</li>

Development Team are the primary evolutionary mechanism
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
In order to guide software evolutionary processes the team needs to understand the ecosystem they are designing for. Traditionally, this has been an exercise in gathering and fixing
requirements/features/stories but this is often flawed as to accurately determine what the Biotope is using static analysis based on peoples interpretation is inherently unconsciously biased.
</p>

<p>
In order to determine what the ecosystem is we need to 'sense' the environment we are in.
