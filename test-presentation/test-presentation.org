* Simple Slides
** This is a simple slide
   
  I've put together a simple slide to prove I can.
  This slide is generated using org mode in emacs,
  exported to reveal.js.

** Includes code

  I wanted to include a 'Hello World' code snippet for Clojure.

  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (defn hello-world [name]
      (println "Hello," name))
  #+END_SRC

** Slide with link

  This slide has a link to my
  [[http://github.com/chrishowejones][Github Account]]

** Slide including an image

  This slide has an image of Spock.
