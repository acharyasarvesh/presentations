* Consumer Contract?

  Each client has it's own requirements
    + Want the fields they want
    + Want to change the state they need to change
    + Want to change requirements independently

* What's wrong with REST?

  How to get different data?
    + Fields listed in GET query string?
    + Fields listed in GET body?
    + Fields listed in POST body?

  The answer is different resources

* What's wrong with REST?

  If I want data from different resources or a graph of 'objects' I
  need multiple calls.

* Postel's Law

  /"Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
  others."/

* Tolerant Reader

  Pattern to tolerate provider changing contract.

    + Does adding fields break consumer?
    + Does not sending non mandatory fields break things?

* Issues with parsers?

  Often parsers in statically typed OOP languages assume rigid
  compliance to schema regardless of consumers needs.

* How does graphql help?

  - Self describing (schema).
  - Queries to fetch only what's required.
  - Can fetch object graph in one call.
  - Can have more than one query per call.
  - 'Mutate' only what's required.

* What's it look like?

  DEMO CAKE!
